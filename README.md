This project utilizes Lodash, Moment, jQuery, and Bootstrap to create a front-end for displaying the list of employees fetched from a teams API hosted on Heroku (https://calm-gorge-86980.herokuapp.com/employees). The list of employees is searchable and displays a modal with more details when each employee is clicked.
